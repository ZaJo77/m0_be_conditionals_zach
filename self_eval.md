# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is useful to use a conditional when you want your code to compare or contrast two or more variables to determine a result like true or false.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would include questions to perplexity alongside google to explain code that I don't understand (not write the code for me, but learn from it when I am struggling unproductively with google.)

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I have felt excited and energized nearly every time I attempt writing code that I am not 100% sure of and it works. Whether it be the first time or after multiple tries, it is a great feeling. It feels good because it is a combination of proof that you understand what you were learning as well as the feeling of having a tool at your disposal to get closer to being able to create things with code.
